Smart Pointer Library Made in C++

This library was created to not only help you understand the ins and outs of smart pointers and memory managements, and be easy and educational, but also serve as a smart pointer library that can not only be used out of the box, but can also be edited however you like.

There are multiple different types of smart pointers, which allows for ownership and borrowing, shared pointers, and garbage collection.
